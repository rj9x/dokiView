# dokiView
File management in a web browser.

# Features
dokiView is a file manager running in a web browser, facilitating easy sharing of documents and files.

# Setup
To use this plugin, download and place the files in a folder on a PHP-enabled server.
Once the files are placed on the server, pointing a browser to that location should present the file browser along with its upload, download, and preview functionality. The plugin can be embedded in an iframe, and no setup or database is required.
